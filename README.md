# Hi there, I'm Edgar Wallace Bowlin III!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate **Applied Computer Scientist** who loves tackling complex problems and transforming ideas into reality. More importantly, I love to break-down and demonstrate that process for potential students to adapt to other, similar problems. Below, you can learn a bit more about my experience, interests, and the projects that drive me.

## Interests & Skills

- **Public-Facing Computer Systems**  
  Crafting intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that make technology more accessible and engaging to the wider public.

- **Science**  
  Exploring the universe and staying curious about how science and technology intersect through both "hard" and "soft" sciences.

- **Microcomputer-Based Interactive Exhibits**  
  Building interactive experiences with microcomputers (like Raspberry Pi or Arduino) that merge hardware and software for educational purposes.

- **Automation & Streamlining**  
  Reducing repetitive tasks by automating workflows—because less time typey-typey, more time thinky-thinky!

- **Artificial Intelligence**  
  Delving into applications of machine learning and AI to real world problems to push boundaries and solve real-world challenges.

- **Full-Stack Development**  
  From front-end design to server-side logic, I enjoy crafting cohesive and robust applications that exemplify execellent coding standards (as time allows!).

- **Gaming**  
  Keeping up with gaming technologies and frameworks, staying inspired by creative problem-solving in games, and understanding how to take seemingly boring technology to create innovate and enjoyable pieces of software.

- **Making Computer Science Accessible**  
  Sharing knowledge through tutorials and demos, aiming to spark enthusiasm for programming in others. The goal is to make this discipline easier to access for not only computer-savvy individuals, but also those who may lack experince in modern computing!
